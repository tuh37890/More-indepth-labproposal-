# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Fun With Coloring Zoo animals
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Interactive coloring book;shows user how to draw and color a zoo animal

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My software will use turtle to make the drawing of the shapes and contain for loops to keep asking the user what they want to see and ask them if they would want to see another animal drawn in which they can reply ["yes","y","n",or "no"]. Other features that the simulation will contain is audio in the beginning after the use has selected choose, such as a hooray and maybe even a theme song in the beginning. There will be lots of colors and shapes involved to complete the drawing for each animal. There will be 5 drawings in total, a tiger, penguin, bear, fish, and a flamingo.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Having ever zoo animal drawn and colored

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Having 5 zoo animals fully drawn and colored ad the user being able to decide which one they want

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having 5 zoo animals fully drawn and colored ad the user being able to decide which one they want and theme music being included


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I plan to come to office hours and go to the student success center for tutoring and telling them what my plans are and showing them my code and allowing them provide guidance to get me to my finished outcome by looking over my code and helping me to fix bugs. I exactly 17 days to implement a plan and follow through to create an interactive color book that shows the user how to draw a zoo animal and colors it for them automatically. 
 	Sunday April the 10th I will create the penguin and flamingo
 	Wednesday April 13th I will create the rest of the drawings for the animals
 	Thursday April 14th I will color in the animals.
 	Tuesday April 19th still working on coloring in the animals
 	Wednesday April 20thI will began implement the user input code to allow the user to select what image they want and make it keep running and prompting them to see if they want to draw another drawing or not
 	Thursday April the 21st still working on user input code try to be done with the user input by this date
 	April 22nd try to incorporate sound
 	April 23rd try to incorporate sound
 	April 24th have everything completed
